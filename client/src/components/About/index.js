                        A message from the CEO
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I wanted to take a minute and explain the name of this foundation and the meaning
                        that it signifies. Rudaina was the name of my cousin. She suffered from Infant
                        Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE) as a result of pregnancy related
                        complications. The doctors gave her a life expectancy of just a few years. In 2017,
                        she passed away at the age of 20. After she passed, I was inspired by the pain it
                        brought me that I made it my mission to try and help other families that are going
                        through something similar. The Rudaina Foundation will not just focus on HIE cases,
                        it will develop and grow to help anyone that is going through something so emotional
                        and painful. Whether that help comes from financial resources or through a
                        foundation that can provide support, Rudaina will always be in my heart and will
                        forever fuel my fire to help and contribute all my potential to someone in need.
