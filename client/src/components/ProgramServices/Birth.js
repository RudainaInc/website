                Rudaina Foundation will provide health-related support to women and families
                experiencing pregnancy related complications. This support deals with reducing
                pregnancy related complication costs by providing financial assistance to women
                fighting risk factors like lack of antenatal care, pregnancy induced hypertension,
                prolonged second-stages of labor and delivery by use of instruments or
                emergency caesarian section. Rudaina will also cover the post-pregnancy
                treatments of the complications listed in our mission. Example treatments Rudaina
                is expecting to provide financial support for are:

                Hypothermia therapy;
                Surgical interventions and medications for cerebral palsy;
                Speech and language pathology;
                Physical, behavioural and emotional therapy;
                Occupational therapy for developing life skills;
                Massage therapy;
                Stem cell therapy; and
                Technologies used for assistance.
                While some of these treatments are covered under provincial health care, Rudaina
                will ensure that any costs that exceed insurance coverage is covered on behalf of
                the applicant.
                Rudaina will conduct in depth verification regarding the applicantâ€™s private
                insurance benefits. This will be done by requesting a copy of their insurance policy
