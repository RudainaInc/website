                A message from the CEO
            </p>

            <p>
                I wanted to take a minute and explain the name of this foundation and the meaning
                that it signifies. Rudaina was the name of my cousin. She suffered from Infant
                Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE) as a result of pregnancy related
                complications. The doctors gave her a life expectancy of just a few years. In 2017,
                she passed away at the age of 20. After she passed, I was inspired by the pain it
                brought me that I made it my mission to try and help other families that are going
                through something similar. The Rudaina Foundation will not just focus on HIE cases,
                it will develop and grow to help anyone that is going through something so emotional
                and painful. Whether that help comes from financial resources or through a
                foundation that can provide support, Rudaina will always be in my heart and will
                forever fuel my fire to help and contribute all my potential to someone in need.
            </p>
