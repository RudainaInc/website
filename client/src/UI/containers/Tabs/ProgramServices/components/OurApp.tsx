                We offer two versions of our App. The app is available on all
                platforms but here’s the catch…one version is free, the other
                costs $2.99. The free version is for people who need to use its
                features. The paid version is used as a new means of fundraising.
                The money goes is strictly used for charitable purposes (after
                paying out the developer fees).
                Our app has three distinct features that are not utilised on our
                website…. Tracking program, uploading medical documents,
                flappy stork the game!...
