                An expecting person will be able to register on our website to start receiving a “life
                basket” every trimester that will provide tailored information to the individual woman. After
                completing the registration process, provided with proof of pregnancy via a doctor’s note, an
                expecting woman will be eligible to receive a package that is personalized to the
                applicant’s: gestational period, age, previous pregnancies, relationship status, social and
                dietary lifestyle, and household income.
